          The Bike Lamp Movie is a documentary project where I handled
          videography, editing, and creative problem-solving. Recording the
          video was both enjoyable and challenging, requiring attention to
          detail to capture shots that aligned with the story's narrative. This
          process taught me the importance of planning each shot with editing in
          mind.

        <p>
          For editing, I transitioned from Adobe After Effects to Davinci
          Resolve, adapting to new workflows and refining techniques like color
          grading, transitions, and audio adjustments. Highlights included
          creating an animated title reveal, blending shots with seamless
          transitions, and adding 'crime scene' imagery for dramatic effect.
          This project sharpened my technical and storytelling skills in video
          production.
