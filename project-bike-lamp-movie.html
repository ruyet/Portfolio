                Bike Lamp is a mockumentary-style video project about a missing bike lamp, where I worked on planning, filming, and editing. We started with a storyboard and script, then filmed the scenes using a custom-designed background setup to make the interviews
                look realistic.

            <p>
                I handled most of the editing, first learning DaVinci Resolve for video cuts and color grading, then switching to After Effects for sound, transitions, and an animated title reveal. I also experimented with visual effects like crime-scene photos and dramatic
                lighting to enhance the story.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project taught me how to think ahead while filming, edit with intention, and use visual details to support storytelling. It was a fun but technical project that challenged both my creativity and editing workflow.
