                Jumper is a 2D platformer game inspired by the classic jump quests in MapleStory. The goal was to create a challenging but fun experience through precise controls, smooth animation, and thoughtful level design.

            <p>
                I built the game in Unity using tilemaps, custom animations, and key mechanics like walking, jumping, crouching, climbing, and knockback—powered by Rigidbody2D and Animator components. To ensure fluid gameplay, I fine-tuned the collision detection and
                adjusted movement for a responsive feel.
            </p>
            <p>
                Level design was central to the experience. I used a Cinemachine camera setup to track the player while keeping the camera within the bounds of the level. I also designed UI elements like the main menu and loading screens to give the game a more polished
                look and feel.
            </p>
            <p>
                Everything in the game was built from scratch—no pre-made assets—so I could stay in full control of the style and mechanics. This project helped me grow both as a programmer and as a designer, especially in understanding how small decisions affect gameplay
                and player experience.
