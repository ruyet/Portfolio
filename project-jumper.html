          JUMPER is a 2D platformer game inspired by the iconic jump quests in
          MapleStory. Developed in Unity, this project focuses on creating a
          challenging yet enjoyable experience through precise mechanics,
          animations, and level design.

        <p>
          The development began with setting up the foundational structure,
          including tilemaps, sorting layers, and custom animations. I
          implemented key mechanics such as walking, jumping, crouching,
          climbing, and knockback using Unity's Rigidbody2D and Animator
          components. Movement and collision detection were refined for
          responsive and immersive gameplay, ensuring a smooth player
          experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Level design required precise platform placement, complemented by a
          Cinemachine-powered camera system that follows the player while
          staying within the playable area. UI elements, including a custom main
          menu and loading screens, were designed to provide a polished game
          flow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every aspect of the game, from animation transitions to camera
          mechanics, was coded and tested in Unity, avoiding pre-built assets to
          maintain creative control. This hands-on approach enhanced my coding
          and game development skills, culminating in a platformer that balances
          challenge and accessibility.
