            <p>
                Lider Reizen is a branding and web design project for a travel agency based in Helmond. The goal was to create a clean, modern landing page and a refreshed brand identity that felt more professional and aligned with current design trends.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started by redesigning the logo, since the existing one was outdated and hard to work with. After researching typefaces and gathering feedback from users and the stakeholder, I selected a modern sans-serif font and created an airplane icon from a side
                view to represent travel in a subtle way. The final logo uses a dark blue gradient to convey trust and professionalism—qualities important for a travel brand.
            </p>

            <p>
                From there, I created a high-fidelity landing page prototype in Figma. While I didn’t have time to go through a full low-fidelity phase, I treated each version as an iteration. I continuously asked for feedback from users and the stakeholder, who suggested
                things like changing the contrast, adjusting layout spacing, and making sure the design better reflected that it was a travel agency.
            </p>
            <p>
                I made several refinements across multiple versions—changing background images, adding a partner slider, adjusting font sizes, and simplifying service labels to improve clarity. I also redesigned the “Contact” button for better visual emphasis and tested
                color contrast and layout variations to find the right balance between modern and professional.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project taught me how important small visual choices can be for a brand’s perception, and how useful feedback is when refining a design. It also helped me grow in logo design, layout composition, and thinking like both a designer and a developer.
